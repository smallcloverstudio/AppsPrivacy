Privacy
==============

At SmallClover, we are committed to protecting the privacy and personal information of our players. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you play our ad-supported games.

## Data Collection:

We do not collect any personal information or data from our players. However, we do display third-party ads within our games, and these ads may collect certain information about you. This information may include your IP address, device type, and other non-identifying information that helps advertisers deliver more relevant ads.

## Use of Information:
The information collected by third-party advertisers is used solely for the purpose of delivering targeted ads to you. We do not share any of your personal information with these advertisers.

We do not sell or disclose any of your personal information to third parties, and we do not use your personal information for any other purpose other than displaying ads within our games.

## Data Security:
We take data security seriously and have implemented appropriate security measures to protect the personal information of our players. However, no security measures can provide complete protection against all risks of data breach or unauthorized access.

## Your Choices:
If you do not wish to receive targeted ads, you can opt-out of interest-based advertising by adjusting the settings on your device. Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean that you will stop seeing ads altogether, but it will prevent advertisers from using your information to deliver targeted ads.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy:
We reserve the right to update this privacy policy at any time. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about our data collection practices.

If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please contact us at smallclover.st@gmail.com.
